            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Faculty of Engineering and Technology</p>
            <p>Faculty of Engineering and Technology is composed of an Institute and six departments: Prof. A. H. S.
                Bukhari Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Department of Electronics Engineering,
                Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Department of Information Technology, Department of
                Software Engineering, Department of Telemedicine and e-Health and Department of Industrial Electronics
                Engineering. A. H. S Bukhari Institute of Information and Communication Technology is an independent
                post-graduate institute offering MS/MPhil programs in disciplines of Electronics, Telecommunications,
                Information Technology and Software Engineering, and PhD degree program in Information Technology.
                Currently, over 300 students are enrolled in all MS/ MPhil and PhD programs. Department of Electronics
                Engineering and Department of Telecommunication Engineering offers a 4-year 8-semester undergraduate
                program, namely BS Electronics Engineering and BS Telecommunication Engineering and both these programs
                are accredited with Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC). Department of Information Technology and
                Department of Software Engineering offers a 4-year 8-semester undergraduate program, BS Information
                Technology and BS Software Engineering respectively and both programs are accredited with the National
                Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC). Both BS Information Technology and BS Software
                Engineering programs are offered in morning as well as in evening.</p>
            <p>Faculty of Engineering and Technology has an excellent infrastructure in terms of highly qualified
                faculty members (there are around as many as 20 PhD faculty members and most of them have earned their
                degrees from educationally advanced countries), well-equipped state-of-the-art laboratories catering the
                needs of practical component of all undergraduate and graduate program courses, spacious class rooms,
                multimedia facilities, computerized internal library with bundant and latest editions of books, journals
                and magazines. The Faculty of Engineering and Technology infrastructure also provides access to digital
                libraries including IEEE, ACM, Elsevier, and Springer Link subscription, and it has also its own
                Research Journal named University of Sindh Journal of Information and Communication Technology (USJICT).
                Realizing the tremendous potential of technology entrepreneurship, FET has adopted a proactive role for
                supporting entrepreneurship through establishment of Technology Incubation Center and Industry Liaison
                Desk.</p>
            <p>The mission of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology (FET) is to provide dynamic learning with
                quality education through rigorous teaching and research methodologies in Engineering and Technology
                disciplines. Academic programs with quality curricula focus to forge professionals, experts and scholars
                in the field of Information Technology, Telecommunication Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Software
                Engineering, Telemedicine &amp; E-Health and Industrial Electronics Engineering. It aims to foster such
                values amongst its academia, undergraduates and graduate scholars, ensuring a place of pride in the
                world of learning.</p>
